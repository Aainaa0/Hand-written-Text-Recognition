# Hand-written Text Recognition
By Lumineux Sdn. Bhd.

This is a project which can interpret the user's handwritten characters or words. This project involve Artificial Intelligence(AI) technique which is Neural Network(NN).

## IAM dataset
Follow these instructions to get the IAM dataset:
<ul>
  <li> Register for free at this <a href="http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database">website</a> </li>
  <li> Download words/words.tgz </li>
  <li> Download ascii/words.txt </li>
  <li> Create a directory for the dataset on your disk, and create two subdirectories: img and gt </li>
  <li> Put words.txt into the gt directory </li>
  <li> Put the content (directories a01, a02, ...) of words.tgz into the img directory </li>
</ul>
Or you can download the data file from this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AtWisxpjfZPaKAdphJ93dk550fTwwdub?usp=sharing">link</a>


## Project Management Plan
**Project Definition**: [Project Definition](PMP/A-Project_Definition.md)

A brief overview of the project summary, team members and objectives of the project.

**Project Planning**: [Project Planning](PMP/B-Project_Planning.md)

Project planning is at the heart of the project life cycle.The planning phase is when the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements are defined, and the project schedule is created.

**Project Implementation**: [Project Implementation](PMP/C-Project_Implementation.md)

The implementation phase involves putting the project plan into action and your project team actually do the project work to produce the deliverables. The deliverables for your project include all of the products or services that you and your team are performing for the client, customer, or sponsor, including all the project management documents that you put together.

**Project Execution**: [Project Execution](PMP/D-Project_Execution.md)

Project Execution is the execution phase where the result, coding blocks and technical implementation is defined and documented.

**Project Closing**: [Project Closing](PMP/E-Project_Closing.md)

Project Closing indicate the end of the project lifecycle where the project need to document closing document and lesson learnt report.

**Project Presentation**: [Project Presentation](PMP/F-Project_Presentation.md)

Project Presentation shows the demonstration of the Hand-written Text Recognition system developed by Lumineux Sdn. Bhd.
