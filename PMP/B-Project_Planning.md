# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT
### Project Management Life-Cycle
The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of Gantt Chart. A Gantt chart is a project management tool assisting in the planning, showing start and end dates, as well as dependencies, scheduling and deadlines, including how much of the task is completed per stage and who is the task owner.

The WBS is the Work Breakdown Structure. It is a hierarchical representation of the elements (tasks) that comprise a project. WBS of our project is shown below:

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)
| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|     :---:       |           :---:             |           :---:           |           :---:          |
| Quality         | git status                  | git status                | git status               |
| Cost            | git diff                    | git diff                  | git diff                 |
| Time            |git diff                    | git diff                  | git diff                 |
